# La France Disease

La France Disease in Cultivated Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus)
Background and Nomenclature

La France disease is a viral disease of the cultivated button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). It was first observed in 1948 on a Pennsylvania farm owned by the La France brothers
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Early accounts referred to the malady by various names – die-back, watery stipe, X-disease, mummy disease, or brown disease – before “La France disease” became the accepted term
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In the early 1960s, researchers discovered that this disease was associated with viral infection, making it one of the first recognized mycovirus diseases. Notably, Hollings (1962) reported isometric virus-like particles in mushrooms with die-back symptoms
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. This was a landmark finding, as it demonstrated that a fungal disease could be caused by viruses (Hollings 1962, Nature; DOI: 10.1038/196962a0). Since then, numerous studies have investigated the viruses infecting A. bisporus, identifying both spherical (isometric) and rod-shaped (bacilliform) particles in diseased mushrooms
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. La France disease, also sometimes called mushroom die-back, became a serious problem in the 1960s–1970s, causing significant crop losses in North America and Europe
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Fortunately, rigorous hygiene practices (especially limiting the spread of infected spores) eventually brought the disease under control
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Today, La France disease outbreaks are rare in commercial mushroom farms

Symptoms of La France Disease

La France disease is characterized by a wide range of developmental abnormalities in the mushroom crop. The first sign is a delay or stunting of mushroom pinhead development, leading to bare patches on the mushroom beds where no fruiting bodies mature
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. As the disease progresses, infected mushrooms exhibit swollen, elongated stipes (stems) and small, deformed caps that often open prematurely (the veil breaks when the mushrooms are still very small)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This results in so-called “drumstick” mushrooms with long thick stems and undersized caps, which greatly reduces marketable yield
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In some cases, the affected mushrooms may dry up and remain as “mummies” on the casing soil (hence the term mummy disease in older literature). Occasionally, twisted stipes or dark brown discoloration of caps were observed
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, but these latter symptoms were less common in classic La France outbreaks. Infected mushrooms often drop spores prematurely, and a high proportion (65–75%) of those basidiospores carry the infection
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This facilitates spread of the disease within and between crops. Notably, long before the viral etiology was confirmed, experiments showed the disease was infectious and transmitted by spores and mycelial contact, implicating an invisible agent (now known to be viruses)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Table 1 summarizes the major symptoms of La France disease compared to those of the later Brown Cap Mushroom Disease (see further below).

La France disease control: Growers found that raising compost temperatures to ~33 °C for a few weeks could sometimes “heat cure” the mushroom mycelium, reducing or eliminating the virus
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This practice, along with strict sanitation and use of virus-free spawn, helped contain La France disease in the 1980s.

Causal Viruses and dsRNA Segments in La France Disease

By the late 1970s and 1980s, intensive research identified a complex of viruses associated with La France disease. Marino et al. (1976) first isolated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from diseased mushrooms, finding a set of six distinct dsRNA bands by gel electrophoresis
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Subsequent studies using improved methods (e.g. dsRNA extraction from mycelial cultures
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
) revealed a total of nine dsRNA segments consistently associated with La France symptoms
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These nine dsRNAs are considered the viral genomic elements of the La France disease virus complex. A 35 nm isometric virus particle is found in diseased mushrooms and was shown to encapsidate these dsRNAs
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The virus was initially named the La France Isometric Virus (LIV)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Later, as more became known, it was formally renamed Agaricus bisporus virus 1 (AbV1)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AbV1 is now classified in the family Chrysoviridae (a family of multipartite dsRNA viruses) because sequence analysis of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene showed affinity to chrysoviruses
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Indeed, AbV1 represents an unusual chrysovirus with more genome segments than the typical four of that family.

Genome composition: The AbV1 virus has a multipartite dsRNA genome comprising six “major” dsRNAs and three “minor” dsRNAs (nine segments total)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The major dsRNAs (designated L1–L5 and M2) are always present in infected mushrooms at high titer, whereas the minor dsRNAs (M1, S1, S2) are often present in lower amounts and occasionally absent in some isolates
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Table 2 below lists these nine dsRNA segments, their approximate sizes, and known or putative functions. Notably, no cross-hybridization is observed among the segments, indicating that each dsRNA is genetically unique (not subgenomic fragments or defective RNAs)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Current evidence suggests the six major dsRNAs constitute the core genome of AbV1, while the three minor segments may function as satellite dsRNAs that depend on the main virus for replication
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. All nine co-segregate during basidiospore formation, implying they are maintained as a unit (i.e. a single viral “quasi-species” complex) in the host
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

.
Transmission	Vertical: via infected spores (65–75% of basidiospores carry virus)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Horizontal: mycelial fusion (hyphal anastomosis)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Disease largely spread historically by airborne spores from infected crops.	Vertical: via spores (both MVX and BCMD can be spore-transmitted)

pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. MVX outbreaks often traced to reuse of trays/compost containing infected debris.
Control measures	Hygienic practices to prevent spore spread (e.g. filtration, minimal disturbance at harvest)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
; use of virus-free spawn. Heat therapy of colonized compost (≈33 °C) can reduce virus
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These measures have made La France outbreaks rare today
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.	Rigorously isolating affected crops; steaming-off and disinfecting facilities after an outbreak. Research into virus-specific diagnostics (e.g. PCR tests) for early detection
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. There is no cure once a crop is infected, so exclusion and hygiene are key.

Table 2 – dsRNA Genome Segments of Agaricus bisporus virus 1 (La France Isometric Virus)

Segment	Size (kb)	Presence	Putative Function / Notes
L1	~3.8	Major (core)	Encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Defines AbV1 as a chrysovirus-like dsRNA virus.
L2	~3.1	Major (core)	Likely encodes a capsid or structural protein (by analogy to other multipartite dsRNA viruses). Detected in all diseased mushrooms
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
L3	~3.0	Major (core)	Encodes an unknown viral protein; sequence obtained
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 (function not yet determined; possibly a structural or replication protein).
L4	~2.8	Major (core)	Encodes an unknown protein; consistently present in infections
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
L5	~2.6	Major (core)	Encodes an unknown protein; sequence obtained
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 (unknown function).
M2	~1.3	Major (core)	Small dsRNA, consistently present
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
; sequence obtained
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Function unclear (possibly a regulatory or movement protein, though fungi have no extracellular movement phase).
M1	~1.7	Minor (satellite)	Satellite dsRNA – present in lower amounts, sometimes absent
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Likely depends on core virus for replication; may not encode a functional protein (or encodes a small protein of undetermined role).
S1	~0.9	Minor (satellite)	Satellite dsRNA – low molecular weight, often absent in some isolates
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Probably non-coding or encoding a very small protein; associated with La France disease but not essential for infection maintenance.
S2	~0.8	Minor (satellite)	Satellite dsRNA – low molecular weight, often absent
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Non-essential for disease; possibly a defective or subviral RNA maintained by the virus.

Table 2 Notes: The six major dsRNAs (L1–L5, M2) are invariably found together and comprise the genome of Agaricus bisporus virus 1 (AbV1)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The three minor segments (M1, S1, S2) are thought to be satellite RNAs: they do not cross-hybridize with the major dsRNAs and may not encode essential viral functions
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. They tend to co-occur with AbV1 in diseased mushrooms but can occasionally be missing without preventing infection
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The presence of these satellites may modulate disease severity, but their exact role remains uncertain
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Sequencing of five segments (L1, L3, L5, M1, M2) was reported in the early 1990s
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Only L1 was found to contain an open reading frame for the RdRp enzyme (required for replicating the dsRNA genome)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. By contrast, L2 is presumed to encode the coat protein that forms the 35 nm viral capsid, given that purified virions contain a ~90 kDa major protein and two minor proteins (115 kDa and 120 kDa) as structural components
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These virion-associated proteins are encoded by the viral dsRNAs and are readily cleaved by fungal proteases
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, which complicated early attempts to assign protein products to specific dsRNAs.

La France Isometric Virus (AbV1): As shown in Table 2, AbV1 is a multipartite dsRNA virus. It is physically present as isometric virus particles ~34–36 nm in diameter, which can be purified from diseased mushrooms
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. All six major dsRNAs are packaged (likely one per virion, similar to chrysoviruses) so that a complete infection unit consists of multiple particles carrying the different segments
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. AbV1’s closest relatives are plant chrysoviruses and mycoviruses in the family Chrysoviridae, but it is unique in carrying extra satellite RNAs
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The virus was formally accepted as a member of Chrysoviridae by ICTV in the mid-2000s
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Notably, early on there was debate whether AbV1 alone fully explained La France disease, since some isolates showed variation in symptom severity. This led to the proposal to rename it “AbV1” to reflect it as one component of the mushroom virome rather than the sole agent
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. We now know that interactions with other viruses can influence disease expression.

Mushroom Bacilliform Virus (MBV): In addition to AbV1, diseased mushrooms often harbor a rod-shaped virus originally observed in the 1960s
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. This virus, called mushroom bacilliform virus, has a monopartite single-stranded RNA genome (~4.0 kb) and forms bacilliform particles ~19 × 50 nm
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. MBV was isolated and sequenced by Revill et al. (1994, Virology; DOI: 10.1006/viro.1994.1412), who found it encodes an RNA polymerase and coat protein with similarities to plant luteoviruses
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. MBV is the type species of the family Barnaviridae (single-stranded RNA mycoviruses)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. While MBV alone does not cause obvious symptoms in A. bisporus
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, it frequently co-infects mushrooms that have AbV1. In fact, co-infection studies showed MBV can reach titers up to 12× higher in the presence of AbV1 than in a single infection
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, suggesting a synergistic relationship. It is hypothesized that AbV1’s disruption of host defenses allows MBV to replicate more freely
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This synergy may enhance the overall virulence of the La France disease complex
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For practical purposes, AbV1 is considered the primary pathogen causing La France disease symptoms
nature.com
, with MBV as a common associate. Effective control of La France disease required eliminating both viruses, which was achieved by breaking the spore-mediated transmission cycle
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

Emergence of Brown Cap Mushroom Disease (MVX) and Comparison to La France

In the late 1990s, mushroom growers in Europe began encountering a new viral disease that differed from classic La France. First noted in England in 1996 as unexplained crop “browning” and developmental problems
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
, it soon spread to other countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, etc.) in the early 2000s
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The syndrome was initially called “mushroom virus X” (MVX) because its cause was mysterious (the “X” denoting an unknown factor)
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. MVX disease presented a complex of symptoms that could occur singly or together: delayed or uneven cropping, primordia (pin) abortion leading to bare patches, premature opening of caps, malformed or fan-shaped fruit bodies, and notably browning or off-white discoloration of mushroom caps
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Any of these issues would reduce yield and product quality, causing serious economic losses. Over 1996–2000, the number of farms with MVX issues grew, and some symptoms (like the brown-cap phenotype) were reminiscent of La France disease – yet diagnostic tests for the La France virus were negative
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. This indicated a different suite of viruses was involved. By 2000, scientists had associated the new disease with novel dsRNA elements not seen in earlier outbreaks
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
.

Brown Cap Mushroom Disease (BCMD): As experience with MVX accumulated, researchers realized that the brown-cap symptom in particular represented a distinct condition. In many MVX cases outside the UK, the primary complaint was that otherwise normal-looking mushrooms developed an undesirable brown coloration on the cap surface (instead of the usual white)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This symptom was dubbed Brown Cap Mushroom Disease (BCMD) to distinguish it from the “bare-patch” or developmental delays often seen in the UK MVX cases
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In other words, MVX became an umbrella term for a complex of viral symptoms, and BCMD refers specifically to the cap-browning disorder. Molecular analyses later confirmed that different viral agents are likely responsible for different MVX symptoms
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For example, in British MVX outbreaks, growth delay and malformation (without browning) were more common, whereas in mainland Europe the browning was prominent – suggesting a geographical separation of viral strains
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. By the mid-2000s, BCMD was recognized as a distinct viral disease of A. bisporus, albeit part of the broader MVX complex
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Causal viruses of MVX/BCMD: A breakthrough study by Grogan et al. (2003, Mycol. Res.; DOI: 10.1017/S0953756203007202) surveyed mushrooms across the UK and identified 26 unique dsRNA elements present in MVX-affected crops
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. In any given sample, up to ~17 dsRNAs could be detected, although the dsRNA titer was much lower than in La France disease
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. None of these MVX dsRNAs matched the 9 segments of AbV1, confirming this was a new viral complex
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. Of the 26 RNAs, 23 were consistently associated with diseased mushrooms (absent in healthy controls)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Their sizes ranged widely from ~0.6 kb up to ~20 kb
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
. Notably, only a subset of these viruses was linked to cap browning: four low-molecular-weight dsRNAs (~0.6, 0.8, 1.8, 2.0 kb) were regularly present in brown-cap samples, whereas the larger dsRNAs had no clear correlation with the browning symptom
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. A similar study in the Netherlands likewise found five small dsRNAs associated with cap discoloration in brown mushroom outbreaks
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These observations pointed to a partitivirus-like agent as the culprit for BCMD, since partitiviruses typically have 2 genomic dsRNAs of about 1.5–2.5 kb each. Indeed, two of the small MVX dsRNAs (~1.8 and 2.0 kb) appeared in a roughly 1:1 ratio and were hypothesized to represent the bisegmented genome of a new Partitiviridae virus
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Eastwood et al. (2015, Appl. Environ. Microbiol.; DOI: 10.1128/AEM.01093-15) provided further evidence by showing these small dsRNAs (now identified as belonging to “Agaricus bisporus virus 16” (AbV16)) are dramatically up-regulated in mushrooms expressing the brown-cap symptom
researchgate.net
researchgate.net
. In affected fruit bodies, AbV16 RNA levels were orders of magnitude higher than in asymptomatic mushrooms, implicating AbV16 as a key causal agent of BCMD
researchgate.net
. AbV16 was found to be a multipartite dsRNA virus (with four genomic segments) that likely lacks a capsid, placing it in the recently recognized family Polymycoviridae (which comprises capsidless multisegmented dsRNA mycoviruses) – consistent with the failure to see virus particles in EM examinations
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Another virus, “Agaricus bisporus virus 6” (AbV6), which has at least two segments (one ~3.6 kb), was associated with the bare-patch symptom of MVX in some UK cases
researchgate.net
. Meanwhile, among the larger MVX dsRNAs, one ~14.5 kb segment was fully sequenced and classified as Agaricus bisporus Endornavirus 1 (AbEV1)
nature.com
, a single-segment dsRNA virus in the family Endornaviridae that likely causes a cryptic (latent) infection. Another ~17 kb dsRNA showed partial sequence similarity to Hypoviridae (hypovirus-like)
nature.com
. These large viruses might contribute to yield reduction or developmental delays, but do not cause brown caps. In summary, Brown Cap Mushroom Disease appears to be distinct from La France disease in that it is caused by uncapsidated, small-segment RNA viruses (e.g. a partiti/poly-mycovirus), rather than a big encapsidated chrysovirus. Additionally, BCMD emerged in the 1990s in the absence of AbV1, whereas La France was rampant in earlier decades but is now rare
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
wrap.warwick.ac.uk
.

Despite their differences, La France disease and MVX/BCMD share some parallels. Both are virus-induced diseases of A. bisporus, and both can spread via infected spores and mycelial fragments
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In fact, MVX disease was shown to be vertically transmitted in spawn much like La France was in the past
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Control of both diseases relies on excluding infected material and maintaining strict farm hygiene (there are no chemical treatments or “cures” for viral diseases of fungi). One intriguing interaction between the two diseases was noted by Fleming-Archibald et al. (2015): in laboratory tests, the introduction of the MVX viral complex to a culture of the old La France strain caused the mushrooms to exhibit brown discoloration
researchgate.net
. This suggests that under certain conditions, the newer MVX viruses can even infect older mushroom strains, producing novel symptoms. Fortunately, modern commercial mushroom strains are carefully screened, and the incidence of severe viral outbreaks is low. The two historically important virus diseases – La France and Brown Cap (MVX) – have provided valuable lessons in mycovirus management and continue to be closely monitored by the mushroom industry and researchers.

## Investigating the etiology of the _La France_ Isomeric Virus.
"La France disease" of cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is caused by a virus complex historically called Mushroom Virus X (MVX), first described in France in the 1950s. The taxonomy of the causal agent(s) is unusual because it is not a single virus species but a heterogeneous group of double-stranded RNA viruses. Here is the classification as recognized today:

Disease:
Name: La France disease of mushroom (champignon disease)
Host: Agaricus bisporus (edible button mushroom)
Symptoms: Slow growth, poor yield, watery stipe, abnormal fruiting, and collapse of crops

Multiple viruses have been associated as the causal agents of La France disease. Among these, multiple dsRNA viruses have been associated, often referred to as the "Mushroom Virus Complex (MVC)" or "Mushroom Virus X (MVX)". Some viruses associated with La France disease symptoms are still unassigned to families. These viruses are not classified into a single family but belong to different viral lineages, among them have been reported: Partitivirus, (Partitiviridae); Totivirus (Totiviridae); Endornavirus (Endornaviridae, possible involvement), and a couple of unclassified dsRNA viruses.

Current View
The disease is not caused by a single virus but by a complex mixture of mycoviruses. Collectively, these dsRNA viruses are grouped under the historical label “La France Isolate” or “Mushroom Virus X (MVX)”. Because the fungi can harbor several viruses simultaneously, symptoms often depend on virus combinations rather than one specific agent.

Classic La France isometric virus (LIV)
Nine principal dsRNA genome segments are consistently reported (segment names in parentheses), with occasional “minor” segments sometimes seen:
3.6 kb (L1), 3.0 kb (L2), 2.8 kb (L3), 2.7 kb (L4), 2.5 kb (L5), 1.6 kb (M1), 1.35 kb (M2), 0.86 kb (S1), 0.78 kb (S2). 
WRAP
– Early work also reported six major bands 3.8, 3.1, 3.0, 2.8, 2.6, 1.3 kb plus three minor bands 1.7, 0.9, 0.8 kb, showing small sizing differences among studies. 
APS Home
– Three segments were sequenced and sized precisely: M2 ≈1.3 kb, M1 ≈1.55 kb, L3 ≈2.8 kb; a small S3 variant (~0.39 kb) is an internal deletion of M2.

MVX / “brown cap” (often conflated with La France in industry reports)
MVX samples show a set of 26 dsRNA elements spanning ~0.64–20.2 kb, typically non-encapsidated and highly variable by sample. Frequently discussed features:
Common asymptomatic dsRNAs: ~16.2 kb, 9.4 kb, 2.4 kb (often present even when no MVX symptoms are seen).
Bands often linked with brown-cap symptoms: 2.0, 1.8, 0.8, 0.6 kb.
Other recurrent bands include (selection): 18.3, 14.4, 13.6, 12.6, 10.25, 8.6, 7.8, 7.0, 5.4, 4.8, 4.1, 3.6, 3.3, 2.2, 1.6, 1.4, 1.1 kb. (See Fig. 2 in source for the full panel with frequencies across samples.)

Notes for interpretation:
The LIV profile (nine segments) is the classic “La France disease” genome in ~35–36 nm isometric particles; those nine segments are considered the viral genome. 
APS Home
MVX (late-1990s onward) is a complex with many dsRNA elements; profiles vary widely between farms/batches, so single fixed “genome sizes” aren’t used for MVX.

## Constructing a mycovirus database using `esearch` from NCBI
Create a database with all queries assigned to a family within the mycovirus group.
```bash
esearch -db nuccore -query \
'(Mitoviridae[Organism] OR Narnaviridae[Organism] OR Partitiviridae[Organism] OR Chrysoviridae[Organism] OR Totiviridae[Organism] OR Polymycoviridae[Organism] OR Fusariviridae[Organism] OR Hypoviridae[Organism] OR Endornaviridae[Organism] OR Quadriviridae[Organism] OR Yadokariviridae[Organism] OR Botourmiaviridae[Organism] OR Mymonaviridae[ORGANISM] OR Megabirnaviridae[Organism] OR Alternaviridae[Organism] AND (complete genome[Title]))' \
| efetch -format fasta > mycoviruses_by_family.fasta
```
Create a database with all complete genomes assigned to a family within the mycovirus group
```bash
esearch -db nuccore -query \
'(Mitoviridae[Organism] OR Narnaviridae[Organism] OR Partitiviridae[Organism] OR Chrysoviridae[Organism] OR Totiviridae[Organism] OR Polymycoviridae[Organism] OR Fusariviridae[Organism] OR Hypoviridae[Organism] OR Endornaviridae[Organism] OR Quadriviridae[Organism] OR Yadokariviridae[Organism] OR Botourmiaviridae[Organism] OR Mymonaviridae[ORGANISM] OR Megabirnaviridae[Organism] OR Alternaviridae[Organism] AND (complete genome[Title]))' \
| efetch -format fasta > mycoviruses_by_family_completegenome.fasta
```
Create a database with all protein queries assigned to a family within the mycovirus group.
```bash
esearch -db protein -query \
'(Mitoviridae[Organism] OR Narnaviridae[Organism] OR Partitiviridae[Organism] OR Chrysoviridae[Organism] OR Totiviridae[Organism] OR Polymycoviridae[Organism] OR Fusariviridae[Organism] OR Hypoviridae[Organism] OR Endornaviridae[Organism] OR Quadriviridae[Organism] OR Yadokariviridae[Organism] OR Botourmiaviridae[Organism] OR Mymonaviridae[ORGANISM] OR Megabirnaviridae[Organism] OR Alternaviridae[Organism])' \
| efetch -format fasta > mycoviruses_by_family_protein.fasta
```
Create a database with the protein queries from the complete genomes assigned to a family within the mycovirus group.
```bash
esearch -db nuccore -query \
'((Mitoviridae[Organism] OR Narnaviridae[Organism] OR Partitiviridae[Organism] OR Chrysoviridae[Organism] OR Totiviridae[Organism] OR Polymycoviridae[Organism] OR Fusariviridae[Organism] OR Hypoviridae[Organism] OR Endornaviridae[Organism] OR Quadriviridae[Organism] OR Yadokariviridae[Organism] OR Botourmiaviridae[Organism] OR Mymonaviridae[Organism] OR Megabirnaviridae[Organism] OR Alternaviridae[Organism])) 
 AND "complete genome"[Title]' \
| elink -target protein \
| efetch -format fasta > mycovirus_proteins_from_complete_genomes.faa
```

Create the databases for complete genome, proteins from complete genomes, all nucleotide sequences and proteins
```bash
makeblastdb -in mycoviruses_by_family.fasta -dbtype nucl -out virusDBnc -parse_seqids -hash_index -title "Mycoviruses (nucl)"

makeblastdb -in mycoviruses_by_family_protein.fasta -dbtype prot -out virusDBaa -parse_seqids -hash_index -title "Mycoviruses (aa)"

makeblastdb -in mycoviruses_by_family-completegenome.fasta -dbtype nucl -out virusDBgeno -parse_seqids -hash_index -title "Mycoviruses (geno)"

makeblastdb -in mycovirus_proteins_from_complete_genomes.faa -dbtype prot -out virusDBprot -parse_seqids -hash_index -title "Mycoviruses (prot)"
```
blastnx, position 1, indicates the number of hits, in this case 3, although recommeded is 5; position 2, calls the database for nt; position 3, calls the database for aa. 
```
sh ~/git_local/LaFrance/script/blastnx.bash fof.txt 3 ~/git_local/LaFrance/databases/virusDBgeno ~/git_local/LaFrance/databases/virusDBaa
```

# R session

```R
blast <- read.table("blast_results/blastn/SW57_scaffolds_subset_blastn_res.tsv", sep = "\t")
header = c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "qcovs", "evalue", "bitscore", "staxids", "sscinames", "scomnames", "sskingdoms", "stitle")
colnames(blast) <- header
head(blast)

blast$SeqID <- sapply(strsplit(blast$sseqid, "\\|"), `[`, 2)
toRetrieve <- blast$SeqID |> unique()
write.table(toRetrieve, "AccNo_to_retrieve.txt")
```

Next steps: Retrieve the nucloetide Acc. Nos. for sequence clustering.
